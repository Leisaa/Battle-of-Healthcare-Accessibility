# Battle-of-Healthcare-Accessibility

# In this project, I explore the difference between American and Canadian healthcare by delving examining
# the healthcare accessibility of Boston and Toronto, which in my opinions are representative of each 
# respetive country. For simplicity, two factors - wait-time (facility resources) and cost are determined 
# to evaluate overall accessibility.
# Wait-time is indirectly derived by looking at the number of available facilities per capita, which is
# provided by Foursquare API. Cost information is found through online resources.
# In the last part, I attempt to cluster healthcare facilities based on distribution within each Toronto 
# ward. The goal is to determine intrinsic similarities between wards and to help make business decisions.
